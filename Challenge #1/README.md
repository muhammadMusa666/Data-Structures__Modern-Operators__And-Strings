# In This Subrepo, You Will Be Doing The Challenge I Talked ABout In The Previous Subrepo, So I Dont Have Much To Say Aside From Good Luck, Dont Be Mad Or Sad When You Dont Get It Perfectly, If You Cant And Couldnt Do The Last 2 Tasks, Then No Worries Because They Were The Hardest Of The 7 Tasks, And Doing 4 Of The 7 Is Completely Reasonable, Actually, Just Trying Is Completely Great, Its Where All Web Devs Started From Afterall, So Failing Is Compulsory, But Anyways, Keep Progressing, Let Me Know If Any Errors Occur, I Hope U Like It!
