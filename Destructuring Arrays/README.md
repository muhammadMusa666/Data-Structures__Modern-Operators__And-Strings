# In This Subrepo, We Will Be Destructuring And Learning More About Arrays, Also I'm Not Sure If I Mentioned Earlier In The Section's README.md File, But In This Section We Will Basically Continue Learning Basic Syntax And JavaScript Features, But With A Focus On More Modern JavaScript This Time, Also, For This Entire Section, There Will Be A Sort Of Theme, Which Will Be Simulating A Food Delivery Application, Specifically An Italian Restaurant, Not To Warn You, But This Section Will Feature Some Complex Topics, But No Extra Knowledge Needed Like Before😅, This Was Also Incredibly Long, It Took Me Sometime To Make This, So Hopefully You Can Learn Something From This😄, But Anyways, Best Of Luck Completing This Section, Let Me Know If Any Errors Occur, And Like Many Times Before, And Once More....I Hope U Like It😆!
