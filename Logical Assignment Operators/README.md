# In This Subrepo, We Will Be Learning About 3 New Operators, Which Are Called "Logical Assignment Operators", These Are Very Helpful And Important In Tons Of Situations, So Hopefully You Learn From Me, From Other Sources Of Yours, And Learn How, Why And When To Use These Operators, The Next Subrepo Will Be A Challenge For You Guys, So Keep Practicing For It, As It Will Test Your Skills Learnt From This Section😄, Also, In Total This Section Will Have 4 Challenges, So In Your In For A Ride🚀, Not A Fun One I Would Say😅, But You Can Definitly Overcome These Challenges, I Would Say This Section Wasnt That Hard, Even Though They Are Long, Its Mostly Because Of The Already Written Code That Makes It Look Long, This Subrepo, Was Also Somewhat Long, Because We're Still Including The Already Written Code Which Makes It Look So😄, Either Way, Even If You Fail Or Dont Get It The Challenges Done Perfectly, You Atleast Tried, Which Is The Whole Point, Soon Enough You'll Overcome Those🫡, Thats If You Fail In The Upcoming Challenges, Which I Doubt😉, But Anyways, Let Me Know If Any Errors Occur. I Hope U Like It!
