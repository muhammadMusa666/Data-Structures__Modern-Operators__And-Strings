# In This Subrepo, We Will Be Learning About Short Circuiting, Which Is Basically Something Related To The 'OR' And 'AND' Operators That We've Gone Over Before, But Hadnt Fully Understood It😄, Since We've Learnt About This Somewhat Before, It Wont Be Hard, Yes It Wont So Dont Worry😉, I Also Tried My Hardest On This To Make It As Short As Possible, But It Still Came Out Pretty Long😅, Not That'll Affect You Though, Since Most Of It Is Just The Already Written Code About The Italian, And Used In The Future, Mexican Food Objects, I Also Promise, The Next One Will Definitly Be Short, Possibly😅, But Anyways, Keep On Coding And Learning New Stuff From This, And Other Sources I Might Have Possibly Redirected You To Due To The Previous Section..., Still Makes You Independent To Have More Sources Than This And Me Like I Always Say😄, Anyways, Let Me Know If Any Errors Occur, I Hope U Like It!
